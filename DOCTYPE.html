    <h1>Impact Analysis: Replacing "Comments" with "Convos" in Tickets</h1>

    <p>This document outlines the key aspects of the user request to replace the existing "Comments" feature with a more dynamic "Convo" system within tickets, along with an analysis of the potential impacts and a recommended approach.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. What the User Asked For</h2>

    <p>The core request is to <strong>deprecate the "Comments" feature entirely</strong> from tickets and replace it with a richer, more interactive "Convo" system.</p>

    <p><strong>Key User Requirements:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rename every UI label from ‚ÄúComments‚Äù to ‚ÄúConvo‚Äù.</li>
        <li>Support rich conversational features instead of flat threads, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Threaded replies.</li>
                <li>Emoji reactions (e.g., ‚ù§Ô∏è, üëç).</li>
                <li>Ability to "Convert to task" directly from any message.</li>
                <li>Standard message actions like pinning, editing, and deleting (where applicable).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ensure every "Convo" remains contextually tied to its specific ticket.</li>
        <li>Make the expansion and visibility of the "Convo" as fluid and intuitive as a standard chat interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Direct User Quotes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>"Please no more comments in the app‚Äîonly Convos in context.‚Äù</em></li>
        <li><em>"I want to reply to that‚Ä¶love it‚Ä¶turn it into a task‚Ä¶not possible with current comments.‚Äù</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Pragmatic Recommendation: Phased Rollout</h2>

    <p>To minimize risk while delivering the richer "Convo" experience the user has requested, a phased approach is recommended:</p>

    <h3>Phase 1 ‚Äî Coexistence & Initial Migration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduce "Convos" as a new feature alongside the existing "Comments" system within tickets.</li>
        <li>Migrate existing comments into a ‚Äúlegacy thread‚Äù format within the new Convo system (perhaps read-only or with limited interaction initially).</li>
        <li>Optionally, provide a UI toggle allowing users to switch between viewing old "Comments" and new "Convos" for a transition period.</li>
        <li>Focus on building core Convo features: threaded replies and reactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Phase 2 ‚Äî Feature Parity, Validation & Soft Deprecation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement remaining Convo features like "Convert to task," editing, etc.</li>
        <li>Soft-delete legacy "Comments" data (mark as inactive, hide from default view) in favor of the migrated Convos.</li>
        <li>Actively monitor the adoption of "Convos."</li>
        <li>Collect user feedback and fix bugs related to reactions, replies, and task conversions.</li>
        <li>Communicate the upcoming full transition to users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Phase 3 ‚Äî Full Cut-Over & Deprecation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove all code paths related to the old "Comments" system.</li>
        <li>Globally rename UI labels and menu items from "Comments" to "Convo."</li>
        <li>Formally deprecate old comment APIs and webhooks (after a suitable notice period if shims were used).</li>
        <li>Clean up any remaining migration artifacts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This approach lets you measure impact, gather feedback, and iterate before fully committing to removing the old comments model‚Äîminimizing risk while delivering the richer Convo experience the user has requested.</p>
